# llama.cpp – Adaptive Speculation + Fastest Vulkan on AMD Strix Halo

**Adaptive speculative decoding that actually works**  
Draft length follows measured acceptance instead of a fixed `n`.  
Combined with a heavily optimized Vulkan backend for AMD Strix Halo (stock Mesa RADV, no ROCm required).

### Headline numbers (AMD Strix Halo / Radeon 8060S)

| Model                   | Metric                | Result                    | Baseline                                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Qwen3.8-27B** (FP4)   | Generation            | **65.6 t/s** structured   | **4.7x** bare decode, unreachable upstream |
|                         | Prefill (pp512)       | **440 t/s**               | +13 % vs mainline at pp2048               |
| **Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B**  | Prefill (ubatch 2048) | **~1616-1648 t/s**        | **1.9x mainline**                         |

Adaptive draft (n\_min=3, n\_max=7) keeps **96 % acceptance** while drafting longer.
Fixed `n=7` collapses to 18 % acceptance. Same ceiling, completely different result:

| Qwen3.8-27B, adaptive DFlash2, FP4 target + FP4 sidecar, greedy, 300 tokens | structured output | prose |
|---|---|---|
| bare decode | 14.0 t/s | 14.1 t/s |
| fixed draft n=3 | 41.6 | 25.4 |
| fixed draft n=7 | 20.2 | 24.8 |
| **adaptive draft, `n_max 7` `n_min 3`** | **65.6 t/s - 4.7x** | **26.1** |

Draft acceptance is what moves: fixed n=7 collapses to 18 %, fixed n=3 sits at 95 % and is
*under*-drafting, adaptive holds 96 % while drafting longer. The same `n_max` that destroys the
fixed arm is safe under adaptive. MTP uses the target's own nextn layers and needs no sidecar;
DFlash2 uses one. Adaptive works on both.

This fork:

- Makes speculative decoding (MTP / DFlash2) **adapt** to real acceptance rates
- Delivers the fastest Vulkan path we have measured on Strix Halo with stock Mesa
- Properly accelerates the exact batch widths (3-8) that speculation needs
- Ships working ROCmFPx / FP4 support with high-performance Vulkan kernels

**Prefill, 440 t/s.** Same 27B, `pp512`, Q4_K or FP4 (they tie). Against pinned
upstream `95b8e33e1`, stock K-quants, no ROCmFPx:

| context depth | 0 | 4 K | 16 K | 32 K | 64 K |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.8-27B UD-Q4\_K\_XL | **+13.0 %** | +11.6 % | +9.1 % | +8.2 % | +4.6 % |
| Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B Q4\_K\_M | **+12.6 %** | +10.0 % | +5.9 % | +5.1 % | noise |

The gain decays with depth — as context grows, attention takes a larger share of prefill and the
matmul and concat paths this fork tunes take a smaller one. Generation on stock K-quants is flat
within ±1 %; the fork's generation story is speculative decoding and ROCmFPx, neither of which a
plain `llama-bench` run can see.

**At ubatch 2048 the gap becomes 1.9x.** Those percentages are at ubatch 512. Raise the ubatch on
the MoE and mainline goes backwards while this fork goes forwards:

| Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B Q4\_K\_M, ubatch 2048 | mainline `95b8e33e1` | this fork | |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| pp512 | 1144.3 | 1289.7 | +12.7 % |
| pp2048 | 870.5 | **1648.5** | **+89.4 %** |
| tg64 | 76.6 | 76.8 | tie |

Two independent sessions measured that fork cell at 1615.7 and 1648.5 t/s, so the headline quotes
the lower one. Mainline at ubatch 2048 is slower than mainline at ubatch 512 (870.5 against 1144.3). The
tiled concat-transpose and the mul\_mat\_id stack are what turn a wide ubatch from a regression
into the fastest setting available. This is the single largest measured gain in the fork.

**Individual Vulkan gates**, measured on/off in one binary at `pp2048`:

| gate | Qwen3.8-27B dense | Ornith MoE | HauhauCS Q6\_K MoE |
|---|---|---|---|
| tiled concat-transpose | +3.3 % | **+45.1 %** | **+49.3 %** |
| f16 B for `mul_mat_id` | — | +6.9 % | +9.1 % |
| f16 B for `mul_mat` | +4.5 % | — | +5.8 % |
| LDS stride pad | +7.3 % | — | — |

Single Radeon 8060S (Strix Halo APU), RADV / Mesa 26.0.8, idle GPU, arms interleaved in palindrome
order against upstream `ggml-org/llama.cpp` `95b8e33e1` — the exact commit this fork merged, so the
delta is this fork's changes and not upstream drift.

**Two caveats that matter.** The speculative table was taken on a short high-power burst (79 °C,
115 W) that this chassis cannot sustain all day; on the everyday power profile the same
configuration reads **55.0 t/s** on structured output. And every generation figure needs its context
depth attached — these models declare 262144 context and generation at depth is roughly a third of
its depth-0 value.

Structured data, methodology and charts: [`bench/`](bench/) —
[`RESULTS.md`](bench/RESULTS.md), [`charts.html`](bench/charts.html),
[`README.md`](bench/README.md).

## Why this fork exists

Two problems that don't have a one-line answer:

1. **Speculative decoding lives at batch 3–8.** Every method — DFlash2, MTP,
   DSpark, ngram — verifies several drafted tokens in one batch. But the Vulkan
   mat-vec kernels fall apart in exactly that range: a stock upstream IQ3_S
   shader overflows the VGPR budget at `NUM_COLS > 4` and is **5× slower** at
   the width the method needs. The fix is a register-spill elimination in a
   shader that upstream has, but nobody noticed because single-token decode
   never reaches that width.

2. **FP4 / FPx weights beat K-quants at batch 1 and lost at batch 8.** Two
   shader changes — amortising the UE4M3 scale decode over a whole 32-weight
   block, and replacing the per-weight bit-window gather with a branch-free
   one — fixed the batching. Mainline cannot load these models at all, so the
   question of making them fast doesn't arise upstream.

The one-constant LDS stride fix is the surprise: a four-way bank conflict in
the coopmat matmul that costs 17–18 % at the kernel level and 12–14 % at the
benchmark level, on **every non-Intel device**, with **any quant**. It's
upstreamable and is the single biggest win in this fork.

## What's in the fork

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| **Adaptive speculation** -- `--spec-draft-adaptive`, MTP or DFlash2 | New here. Draft length tracks accepted tokens; `n_max` is a ceiling. Recommended: `--spec-draft-adaptive --spec-draft-n-min 3` |
| **ROCmFPx quant types** — Q4\_0\_ROCMFP4, \_FAST, Q2/Q3/Q6/Q8\_0\_ROCMFPX, CPU codecs + Vulkan dequant / mat-vec / matmul / integer-dot kernels | Hand-ported from ciru-ai/ROCmFPX, a fork of charlie12345/ROCmFPX where the ROCmFP4 format originates. Two decode bugs fixed here — see `ROCMFPX-NOTES.md` |
| **Vulkan batched mat-vec fixes** — IQ3\_S register spill at `NUM_COLS > 4` (5× at n=8), ROCmFPx batch 3–8 rework | New here. Both upstreamable |
| **Vulkan LDS stride fix** — `SHMEM_STRIDE` pad, +7.3 % prefill on any quant, +10–20 % at the kernel | New here. One constant. Upstreamable. Now driver-gated, see below |
| **Vulkan prefill gates** — tiled concat-transpose, f16 B operand for quantized matmul and matmul\_id | Ported from [Nathanw1014/llama.cpp](https://github.com/Nathanw1014/llama.cpp/tree/strix-halo-vulkan). Re-measured here, see [`bench/`](bench/) |

## Against mainline — Vulkan only, stock K-quants

Same CMake flags, clean worktree, interleaved on an idle GPU. No ROCmFPx,
no fork-specific model format — this measures the Vulkan work alone.

`pp2048` at ubatch 512 with flash attention on, three repetitions per cell, arms in palindrome
order (fork · mainline · mainline · fork) so clock drift cancels between them rather than being
charged to one, and a discarded warmup per process because this APU gives the first run of a set a
15–20 % boost clock.

| model | metric | depth 0 | 4 K | 16 K | 32 K | 64 K |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| unsloth Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q4\_K\_XL (dense) | pp2048 | **+13.0 %** | +11.6 % | +9.1 % | +8.2 % | +4.6 % |
| | tg64 | −0.7 % | −0.7 % | −0.4 % | −0.6 % | −0.5 % |
| bartowski Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B-Q4\_K\_M (MoE) | pp2048 | **+12.6 %** | +10.0 % | +5.9 % | +5.1 % | noise |
| | tg64 | noise | +1.5 % | +0.7 % | noise | noise |

Absolute t/s and the per-cell spread are in [`bench/RESULTS.md`](bench/RESULTS.md); "noise" marks a
cell under 2σ.

### Where the win is, and where it is not

Prefill and generation pull in opposite directions, and which model you run decides which one you
get. Both are measured against the same pinned upstream, on the same box, minutes apart.

| | prefill vs mainline | generation vs mainline |
|---|---|---|
| **Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B** (MoE, MTP) | **+89 %** at ubatch 2048 | parity |
| **Qwen3.8-27B** (dense, DFlash2 + FP4) | +13 % | **4.7x bare decode**, unreachable upstream |

**On Ornith the generation win is not ours.** MTP at a fixed draft length landed upstream and works
there: mainline reaches 104.2 t/s on structured output against this fork's 101.8-104.0, and bare
decode ties to within 0.0 %. That figure belongs to the model and to Strix Halo's bandwidth, not to
this fork. What this fork adds on Ornith is prefill, and it adds a lot of it.

**On the dense 27B the generation win is entirely ours**, because it needs two things upstream does
not have: the ROCmFPx FP4 sidecar and adaptive draft sizing. 14.0 t/s bare decode becomes 65.6 t/s,
a 4.7x that no upstream build can reach at any setting.

The honest one-line summary: run the MoE for prefill, run the dense 27B with a sidecar for
generation. Bare single-stream decode is at the memory wall on this hardware and no kernel work
moves it, which is exactly why the fork's generation effort went into speculation instead.

**The gain decays with depth.** This fork's Vulkan work is in the matmul and concat paths; as
context grows, attention takes a larger share of prefill and those paths take a smaller one. A
single headline percentage would hide that, which is why depth is an axis here and not a footnote.

**Generation is flat on stock K-quants** — a consistent −0.6 % on the dense model, small positive on
the MoE. That is the honest result for this configuration: no speculation, no ROCmFPx, so none of
the paths this fork actually optimises for generation are in play. See the speculative table above
for the case that is.

The MoE now gains as much as the dense model at short context, where an earlier measurement of this
same pair showed only +3.2 %. The difference is the tiled concat-transpose kernel, worth **+45 %**
on its own for delta-net MoE prefill — the generic concat walks the transposed conv-state with a
40960-byte stride, so every read lands on the same one of 16 memory channels.
Generation is unchanged: single-stream decode of a stock K-quant is already at
80 % of theoretical memory bandwidth on this APU — no kernel can move it.
The generation headroom is at the batch widths speculative decoding runs at,
which is where this fork works.

**The fix in one sentence.** `mul_mm.comp` stages shared tiles at
`SHMEM_STRIDE = BK/2 + PAD` in dword units (1:1 with the 32 LDS banks) and
reads B back column-major, so `gcd(SHMEM_STRIDE, 32)` is the conflict factor.
Upstream sets `PAD` only for Intel-on-Windows; everything else takes the
shader default of 4, giving stride 20 → four-way conflict on every B load.
Stride must stay even (an odd stride breaks RADV's wide `ds_read_b64/b128`
path and costs 3×), so any pad with `gcd(BK/2 + pad, 32) == 2` is the fix.
Worth 1.17× on q4\_0 and 1.18× on q8\_0 at the kernel level.

**Why it is driver-gated.** The coopmat path hands `SHMEM_STRIDE` to
`coopMatLoad` as its Stride operand, and the spec wants that 16-byte aligned for
16×16 f16 tiles. Stride bytes are `(BK/2 + pad) * 4`, so only `pad % 4 == 0` is
in contract — every conflict-free pad is out of it. RADV before 25.3 lowers
`coopMatLoad` to `ds_read_b128`, which the contract entitles it to, and the
misaligned rows then pay runtime splits: pp512 collapses by more than 2×. RADV
25.3 and later lowers to `ds_read_b64`, which the stride always suits, and the
bank spread wins. So the fix applies **only on RADV ≥ 25.3**; everything else
keeps the spec-aligned pad 4. `GGML_VK_SHMEM_PAD=N` overrides both, for probing.

## Speculative decoding at the batch widths that matter

DFlash2, MTP, DSpark, and Eagle3 all landed upstream. Having the method is not
the same as having it work well. Speculation verifies several drafted tokens in one
batch, so it lives at **batch 3–8** — exactly the range where the Vulkan
mat-vec kernels were broken:

**IQ3\_S mat-vec, m=4096 k=14336, µs/run — lower is better.**
n is the batch width (how many drafted tokens are verified at once).

| n | mainline | this fork | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 98.3 | 98.0 | parity |
| 2 | 110.7 | 114.0 | −3 % |
| 4 | 167.4 | 172.9 | −3 % |
| **8** | **1542.0** | **285.0** | **5.4×** |

The 3 % at n=2 and n=4 is a real cost, not noise: the fix moves `dscale`
inside the inner loop for every `NUM_COLS`, so the narrow cases pay slightly
for the wide ones. Trading 3 % at n=2 for 5.4× at n=8 is the right side of
that bargain when the whole point is verifying batches of drafts.

**The rest, which mainline has no equivalent for:**

| | mainline | this fork |
|---|---|---|
| ROCmFPx with DFlash2 | cannot load the model at all | 6 quant types, CPU + Vulkan |
| ROCmFPx mat-vec at batch 3–8 | n/a | 312 → 173 µs (fp4), 2236 → 402 (fp6) |
| GDN output projection, multi-slot | one GEMV per sequence | one batch-wide GEMV, +8.6 % at B=8 |

## Measured results

*An earlier measurement set, kept because the bandwidth-wall analysis and the long-context
inversion still stand. It used the z-lab Q8\_0 sidecar at a fixed draft length on the everyday
power profile, so its absolute numbers are lower than the headline above, which used the FP4
sidecar with adaptive drafting on a high-power burst. Compare within a table, not across them.*

### Bare decode is at the memory wall

| model | size | tg128 | achieved | of 256 GB/s peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ROCmFP4\_FAST | 13.55 GiB | 14.05 ± 0.09 | 204.4 GB/s | 79.8 % |
| Q3\_K\_M | 12.56 GiB | 15.18 ± 0.08 | 204.7 GB/s | 80.0 % |

Two decoders with nothing in common — an FP4 codebook with UE4M3 scales, and
Q3\_K superblocks — reach the same bandwidth to three significant figures.
Single-stream decode has very little headroom left. Every remaining gain has to come
from draft acceptance, which multiplies effective bandwidth instead of
competing for it. Performance has become a draft-quality problem, not a kernel problem. At least with these models.

### Speculative decoding, tokens/s

**Short context (~350 tokens):**

| config | prose | code | JSON |
|---|---|---|---|
| bare | 13.90 | 13.90 | 13.89 |
| MTP n=3 | 26.18 | 29.83 | 34.91 |
| DFlash2 · z-lab Q8\_0 n=7 | 21.96 | 35.24 | **41.54** |

**Long context (~31 K tokens of real C source):**

| config | verbatim reproduction | prose about the code |
|---|---|---|
| bare | 12.20 | 12.19 |
| MTP n=4 | **36.07** (97.5 % acc) | 20.54 |
| DFlash2 · Q8\_0 n=7 | 31.79 | 15.69 |
| ngram-simple (no draft) | 25.41 | 11.72 (below bare) |

The ranking inverts with context length. DFlash2 wins at short context —
41.5 t/s on JSON, **3.0× bare**. By 31 K, MTP takes both tasks. The cause is
structural: a DFlash2 sidecar keeps its own KV cache over the full context and
re-runs up to seven times per verification step, so its cost scales with
context. MTP's nextn layer reuses the target's state and never pays that.

Content dominates configuration: identical weights at identical context span
36.07 to 20.54 t/s purely on whether the output is quotable.

### What to run

| situation | method |
|---|---|
| short context, structured output | `--spec-type draft-dflash --spec-draft-adaptive --spec-draft-n-min 3`, z-lab Q8\_0 sidecar, `--spec-draft-n-max 7` |
| long context, any task | `--spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-adaptive --spec-draft-n-min 3` at n-max 3–4 — no sidecar, no second KV cache |
| quote-heavy long context | ngram-simple alone, never layered under a draft model (costs 13 %) |
| **avoid** | ngram-cache (slower than bare), Q2\_0\_ROCMFPX (no Vulkan kernel), DSpark on this target |

Do not requantise the z-lab Q8\_0 sidecar. Our Q8\_0\_ROCMFPX scores 53.5 %
acceptance against z-lab's 60.2 % at the same bpw and identical tensor
routing — it even lands below our own FP4, which is impossible as a
precision effect. The cause is the block scale: Q8\_0 stores an fp16 scale,
ROCmFPx stores a UE4M3 byte. At 8 bits per weight the codes are not the
problem, the coarse scale is.

## Download a prebuilt binary

Linux and Windows x86-64 builds are attached to the
[releases page](https://github.com/LaurentZuijdwijk/llama.cpp/releases) of this fork. No
compiler, no Vulkan SDK, no CMake.

| | |
|---|---|
| Linux x86-64 | `llama-*-bin-ubuntu-vulkan-x64.tar.gz` |
| Windows x64 | `llama-*-bin-win-vulkan-x64.zip` |

```bash
tar xzf llama-*-bin-ubuntu-vulkan-x64.tar.gz
cd llama-*/
./llama --version
```

Both archives are self-contained. On Linux the shared libraries sit next to the
executables and are found through an `$ORIGIN` rpath, so nothing needs installing and
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` stays untouched; on Windows the DLLs sit next to the `.exe` files. Run
them from the folder you extracted. See
[Running it with llama-server](#running-it-with-llama-server) below for the model commands.

**What you need**

| | |
|---|---|
| OS | Linux or Windows, x86-64 |
| driver | any Vulkan 1.3 driver. Measured on Mesa RADV 26.0.8 |
| GPU | any Vulkan device. The Strix Halo gates auto-detect; the rest is generic |
| check | `vulkaninfo --summary` lists your device |

The release binaries are built portable (`GGML_NATIVE=OFF`, plus every CPU variant,
selected at run time). The benchmark figures on this page came from a `GGML_NATIVE=ON`
build. Practically all the work is on the GPU, so the two measure the same, but the
builds are not bit-identical.

Prefer to build it yourself? The flags used for the releases are in
[`.github/workflows/release-vulkan.yml`](.github/workflows/release-vulkan.yml).

### Or use the packaging repo

[**agention-llama**](https://github.com/LaurentZuijdwijk/agention-llama) wraps all of this
in a container image, seven ready-made configurations and a preflight check that tells you
whether the driver gate above is actually taken on your machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurentZuijdwijk/agention-llama/master/install.sh | sh
agention-llama doctor
agention-llama run dflash-fp4
```

It lives outside this tree on purpose, so the fork stays clean and its upstreamable fixes
stay easy to send upstream.

## Running it with llama-server

Two configurations, because **the best ubatch is model-dependent** - see the table below.

```bash
# Dense hybrid: Qwen3.8-27B, FP4 target + FP4 DFlash2 sidecar.
# This is the 65 t/s configuration. ubatch 512 (the default) is fastest here.
llama-server \
  -hf  julianmb/Qwen-3.8-27B-ROCmFP4-FAST-GGUF:FAST \

# Delta-net MoE: Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B, MTP, no sidecar.
# ubatch 2048 is worth +29% prefill here. Keep n-max tight - see the note below.

```

### Choosing `--ubatch-size`

Measured on a Radeon 8060S, flash attention on, five repetitions, warmup discarded:

| model | pp512 ub512 | pp2048 ub512 | pp512 ub2048 | pp2048 ub2048 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.8-27B ROCmFP4-FAST (dense) | **439.3** | **427.4** | 431.0 | 414.8 |
| Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B Q4\_K\_M (MoE) | 1285.8 | 1254.1 | 1261.8 | **1615.7** |

The dense model prefers the default 512; the MoE gains 29 % at 2048 on a long prompt. Do not
generalise one to the other.

This is also where the fork separates from upstream most sharply: at ubatch 2048 mainline drops to
870.5 t/s on the MoE, so the same setting that is this fork's fastest is a regression on stock
llama.cpp. See [Where the win is, and where it is not](#where-the-win-is-and-where-it-is-not).

> **`-ub 2048` at long context can hang the GPU.** On this hardware,
> `-ub 2048` with a context depth at or beyond 65536 reproducibly times out the compute ring
> (`amdgpu: ring comp_1.2.0 timeout`, recovered by a ring reset). It reproduces on **stock upstream
> llama.cpp** as well, so it is not something this fork introduces - but it does mean the MoE's
> ubatch-2048 win is only safe for short-to-mid context. It has been confirmed on the dense model
> and is **untested on the MoE**. At `-ub 512` and `-ub 1024` the same depth completes normally.
> If you serve long context, keep `-ub 512`.

### `GGML_VK_DENSE_WAVE32` on MoE models

Set `GGML_VK_DENSE_WAVE32=1` if you run a mixture-of-experts model. It retiles the quantized
matmul to 32-wide subgroups, and on this hardware that splits by architecture:

| model | quant | off | on | |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B (MoE) | Q4\_K\_M | 1628.1 | **1727.8** | **+6.1 %** |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B HauhauCS (MoE) | Q6\_K\_P | 1520.6 | **1599.3** | **+5.2 %** |
| Qwen3.8-27B (dense), pp512 | Q4\_K\_XL | 438.8 | 429.6 | -2.1 % |
| Qwen3.8-27B (dense), pp2048 | Q4\_K\_XL | 426.8 | 416.6 | -2.4 % |

`pp2048` at ubatch 2048 for the MoE rows, ubatch 512 for the dense rows, five repetitions per
cell, palindrome order (off, on, on, off) so clock drift cancels, GPU otherwise idle.

Two MoE models gain about 5-6 %; the dense model loses about 2 %. That is why it is off by
default rather than on: there is no single right answer. On Ornith it takes prefill to
**1727.8 t/s, very close to 2x mainline's 870.5**.

```bash
GGML_VK_DENSE_WAVE32=1 llama-server -m Ornith-1.5-35B-Q4_K_M.gguf ...
```

Credit for spotting that this flag was never measured end-to-end on a MoE goes to a reader.
It had been tested only as an isolated `MUL_MAT` microbenchmark and under the separate
`GGML_VK_MMID_WAVE32` knob, both of which came back negative and were wrongly assumed to settle
the MoE case.

### `models.ini` form

With `--models-preset`, the same settings as a preset entry:

```ini
[ornith-ai/Ornith-1.5-35B-A3B-GGUF:Q4_K_M]
alias = Ornith-1.5-A3B
spec-type = draft-mtp
spec-draft-n-min = 2
spec-draft-n-max = 4
ubatch-size = 2048
flash-attn = on
n-gpu-layers = 999
```

**Keep `spec-draft-n-max` tight for MTP.** The adaptive controller maximises accepted tokens, not
throughput, and for MTP those diverge: later nextn layers are less accurate while draft cost stays
linear in `n`. On Ornith, `n-max 7` gives 85.7 t/s on structured output against 100.4 at `n-max 4`
and 104.0 at a fixed `n=3`. With a DFlash2 sidecar the picture reverses and `n-max 7` is right.

## Quick start (this fork)

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=ON && cmake --build build -j

# Short context, structured output - DFlash2, adaptive.
# This is the exact pair the 65 t/s figure was measured on. The sidecar is an
# FP4 requantisation of z-lab/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2.

  --spec-type draft-dflash --spec-draft-adaptive --spec-draft-n-min 3 \
  --spec-draft-n-max 7 --spec-draft-ngl 99 -ngl 99 -fa on

# Same with the Q8_0 sidecar. Larger and slower here - on a bandwidth-bound
# APU the cheaper draft wins even at lower acceptance.

# maximises accepted tokens, not throughput, and for MTP those diverge because
# later nextn layers are less accurate while cost stays linear in n.

## Description

The main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM (and VLM) inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on
a wide range of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

- Plain C/C++ implementation without any dependencies
- Apple silicon is a first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks
- AVX, AVX2, AVX512 and AMX support for x86 architectures
- RVV, ZVFH, ZFH, ZICBOP and ZIHINTPAUSE support for RISC-V architectures
- 1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit integer quantization for faster inference and reduced memory use
- Custom CUDA kernels for running LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs (support for AMD GPUs via HIP and Moore Threads GPUs via MUSA)
- Vulkan and SYCL backend support
- CPU+GPU hybrid inference to partially accelerate models larger than the total VRAM capacity

The `llama.cpp` project is build on top of the [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) library.
